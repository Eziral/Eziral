Hello there ! 👋 

I'm Eziral, a newbie Systems Engineer in a french Unicorn 🦄

Considering my job I have to learn a few things in shell bash & Python, so here I am. 

- I'm a real nerd/geek, interested in everythiong related to technology 👾 🎮 💻
- On a previous life I worked for an "🍎" compagny... 🤫
- Video games and tabletop gaming saved my life.
